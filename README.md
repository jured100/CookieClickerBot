This is an implementation of a cookie clicker bot in python using pyautogui. This will not work unless the resolution on your monitor is the same as my own.
My resolution is probably 1920x1080. I will make it so that everyone can use it... eventually... maybe.

The point of this thing is to show my university that I can use git and github. Hello to any school faculty reading this! Please give me a good grade :D

But yeah, this thing is not efficient, I did not use any math, merely my intuitive guess as to what would be good and the results are... well they are decent.
They are not as good as if a human played the game (probably), but the bot can go on forever and a human cannot :)

For any future employers: please do not look at this monstrosity. It is horrible and something I put together in about an hour.

The project does include its own venv (virtual environment) so, as long as you have python installed (and probably also pycharm I dont know), it should work. If it doesn't...
well write a comment and I'll make an exe out of this.
